That was a divider. Is this paragraph long enough to wrap to the next line? I guess maybe not. What about now? Here comes a table:

| Here's                          |          A           |                         Table |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------: | ----------------------------: |
| With                            |         Some         |                          Data |
| But this column is left-aligned | This one is centered | And this one is right-aligned |

Now here come the additional features. Shall we start with equations? Here's an inline equation: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$. And here's a block equation:

$$
e^x = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}x^i
$$

How about some UML diagrams? Here's one:

```plantuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
```

That's all folks :smile: :two_hearts: â€“ you didn't think we forgot emojis, did you?
